# Kit Mule kit (for Infinity Engine games)


#### Info
- Installs a kit that learns every kit/class ability (including HLAs and mod-added ones)
- The ability table is built at install time and is based on your current install.
- usable with EEs and classic BG2


#### Installs under 3 classes:
- Fighter
- Bard
- Druid

NOTE: Install time may take a little longer than a normal kit mod


#### config.ini
- set max level/column to check in kit tables (default = 20)
- enable or disable scanning clab, hla, or mod files
- enable or disable installing fighter, bard, or druid kits

You can set max level to anything, but an error will occur if it tries 
to read an entry that doesn't exist (due to uneven column numbers).
