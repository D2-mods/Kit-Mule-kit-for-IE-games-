Info
- Installs a kit that learns every kit/class ability (including HLAs and mod-added ones)
- The ability table is built at install time and is based on your current install.
- usable with EEs and classic BG2

v1.0
- Added component: Recreate abilities table
- This lets you update kit abilities at any time (more info below)


Installs under 3 classes:
- Fighter
- Bard
- Druid

NOTE: Install time may take a little longer than a normal kit mod


config.ini
- set max level/column to check in kit tables (default = 20)
- enable or disable scanning clab, hla, or mod files
- enable or disable installing fighter, bard, or druid kits

The "level" setting will accept values from 1-50. Any other number will default to 20.
Previous errors caused by uneven column numbers should no longer occur.
