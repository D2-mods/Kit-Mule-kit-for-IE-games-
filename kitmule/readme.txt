Info
- Installs a kit that has every special ability (including HLAs and mod-added ones)
- This kit has no other bonuses. It just learn all abilities.
- usable with both EE and classic BG2


Installs under 3 classes:

config.ini
- set max level/column to check for in 2das (default = 20)
- set a class to = 0 to prevent installing

You can set max level to anything, but an error will occur 
if it tries to read an entry that doesn't exist (due to uneven column numbers).
